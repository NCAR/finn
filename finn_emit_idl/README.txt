While finn_emit python code becomes QA'd here is version of IDL code for calculte finn emissions.

Yu need IDL (harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL) to run.

Run global_fire_*.pro first, then speciate*.pro next

First one have giant function which takes *.csv from finn_preproc as input.  Run the code, get an intermediate, unspeciated text file.

Use the output from above for input to next code (again have a giant function).
