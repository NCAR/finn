Emissions are calculated with the IDL program finn2_calc_emissions_v25.pro using the files produced with the FINNv2.5 Preprocessor, which contain area and landcover type for each fire. 

The finn2_calc_emissions_v25.pro routine reads the other CSV files in the v2.5_emissions_code directory for estimates of fuel load, emissions factors and VOC speciation factors.
