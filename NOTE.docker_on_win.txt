Acquiring this repository

	used github desktop, i guess you can use git clone too

Building the Docker image
	
	cmd is used, i guess powershell work too?

	as instructed.  Take long time where internet connection is not fast
like my home

Starting the Docker container

	docker run

*** if docker run screws up , you go "docker stop finn" and then "docker rm finn"
***  "docker container ls" to get what you have created.
(or "docker ps -a" ? )
***  docker stop finn, docker start finn to stop/start daemon
	- doesnt like single quotes in finn
	- doesnt like $(pwd), should be %cd% ?  
					tried %cd:\=/% too, 
					tried to spell out c:/users/yosuke/documents/github/finn_preproc:/home/finn
					what worked was to drop drive letter and using forward slash,
			like this /users/yosuke/documents/github/finn_preproc:/home/finn 
				
					
				- ask for share dtive, i say share
				- doenst come back to cmd prompt....  opened another cmd, docker ps,
				  but no process running

				- with fix in drive pass, docker run completed, came back to prompt.
				  Windows firewall warns me if i want let docker to access internet.
				  i say allow access
						got this!!

	- what i needed to do, was to go to setting for docker and allow
	  access to c: drive!!!   just responding to the dialog didnt do
anything.  with this change, and with %cd%, docker run success



	docker exec,
	well, it runs, but notebook is empty.  i guess i am not doing correct
for the -v part



to stop the -it version of docker (image?) type ^C at the terminal


i did apt-get install for
vim
man

i did conda install 
beautifulsoup
-c conda-forge pyproj


somehow, i got corrupted hdf file and it was imposiible to delete it.  I ended
up restarting the pc.  i got started writing downloader.py which has
- downlaodall()
	basically doens the same as current bash script
- check_corrupsed()
	matches cksum with xml file
	(TODO) this is supposed to delete the file, but say something if it
	really cannot delete
- get_one()
	(TODO) get just one file
- find_needed_tiles()
	(TODO) given point dataset, identify tiles that is needed
